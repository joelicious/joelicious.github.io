# Introduction

The intent of this document is to organize all my notes during my journey of learning about
integration technologies that can be deployed on a kubernetes / OpenShift platform. Coming
from a background of understanding integration before these platforms, I find that I am
often just trying to adapt what I know to what is now possible.

In the past, when there was no platform to manage your workloads, we would leverage tools
such as Apache Camel and Apache ActiveMQ to build out functionality. Projects such 
ServiceMix and JBoss Fuse assisted in providing a consistent run-time, however many 
enterprise requirements had to be tailored to the infrastructure that was available.

With kubernetes / OpenShift, more of these enterprise requirements can be satisfied in a
consistent manner. And perhaps more importantly, Apache Camel, Apache ActiveMQ, and 
Strimzi (AMQ Streams) have evolved with these platforms. This is where I like to focus
my learning, finding ways that OpenShift can make Integration easier to consume in the
enteprise.

As part of this learning path, I did take a detour in provisioning an OpenShift cluster
in my homelab. This step is certainly not required, however there is a need to have
a place where you can deploy these projects into an OpenShift cluster.

After acquiring a platform for an integration playground, topics that are to be explored 
will start with Camel and its subprojects.

* Camel Core
* Camel K 
* Kamelet
* Camel Quarkus
* Camel Karavan

Messaging

* AMQ Broker
* AMQ Streams
